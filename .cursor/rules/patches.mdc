# Patches

Patches is an unrelease project, in stealth mode, being iterated on until it is ready for a release. Backwards compatability is not a concern. Getting the API right and the code correct and clean is the main concern.

## Project Overview

- **Patches** is a TypeScript library for building real-time collaborative applications using Operational Transformation (OT) with a centralized server model.
- Supports versioning, offline work, branching, and efficient handling of large/long-lived documents.
- All document state is regular JSON-compatible data, managed immutably.

## Key Concepts

- **Centralized OT:** Server is the single source of truth for document history and conflict resolution.
- **Patches:** The main client-side interface, loading docs, syncing with the server, and storing data. Supported by PatchesSync and PatchesStore for implementation.
- **PatchesDoc:** Client-side document, manages local state, optimistic updates, and syncs with server.
- **OTServer:** Server-side OT authority (implements PatchesServer interface), applies/commits changes, manages versions and persistence.
- **PatchesHistoryManager:** Query document versions and change history.
- **PatchesBranchManager:** Supports branching/merging workflows.
- **Backend Store:** You must implement a storage backend (see `OTStoreBackend`/`LWWStoreBackend`/`BranchingStoreBackend` interfaces).

## Directory Structure

- `src/` — Main source code
  - `client/` — Client-side OT implementation (PatchesDoc)
  - `server/` — Server-side OT implementation (OTServer, PatchesHistoryManager, PatchesBranchManager)
  - `net/` — Network layer (WebSocket, protocol, providers)
  - `json-patch/`, `utils/` — Supporting modules
- `docs/` — In-depth documentation for each core component
- `tests/` — Vitest-based test suite (unit/integration)
- `dist/` — Build output
- `assets/`, `.vscode/`, etc. — Miscellaneous/project config

## Files

Imports refer to the *.js file path, but every file is a TypeScript file, so when you see a `.js` file extension in imports, you
can safely assume it is a `.ts` file and look it up accordingly with its `path/to/file.ts` path.

## How to Build & Test

- **Build:**
  `npm run build`
- **Run tests:**
  `npm test` (or `npm run tdd` for watch mode)
- **Write tests:**
  - Place `.spec.ts` files in `tests/` or subfolders.
  - Use [Vitest](mdc:https:/vitest.dev) syntax (see existing tests for examples).

## Coding Conventions

- TypeScript throughout; prefer type safety.
- Use immutable data patterns (do not mutate state directly).
- Organize new OT logic under `src/`.
- Keep all public API changes documented in `README.md` and relevant `docs/*.md`.
- Write beautiful code:
  - Write for humans first, computers second
  - Prefer simplicity over complexity
  - Make your intentions clear through naming and structure
  - Maintain consistency in style and patterns
  - Embrace refactoring as a continuous practice
  - Test thoroughly but purposefully
  - Consider future maintenance in every decision

## Cursor-Specific Rules

- **Never edit files in `dist/` or `node_modules/`.**
- **Do not modify `README.md` or `docs/*.md` unless explicitly requested.**
- **When adding new features, update or create relevant documentation in `docs/`.**
- **Tests must be added/updated for all new features or bugfixes.**
- **When making changes to OT logic, ensure both client and server code are considered.**

## Documentation Map

- `README.md` — High-level intro, usage, and examples.
- `docs/operational-transformation.md` — OT algorithm, client-server flow, backend interface.
- `docs/PatchesDoc.md` — Client-side API.
- `docs/PatchesServer.md` — Server-side API.
- `docs/PatchesHistoryManager.md` — Version/history API.
- `docs/PatchesBranchManager.md` — Branching/merging API.
- `docs/json-patch.md` — JSON Patch/legacy features.
- `docs/net.md` — Network layer (WebSocket, protocol, providers)
- `docs/persist.md` — Storage implementations and offline support.
- `docs/awareness.md` — Awareness (presence, cursors, etc.) via WebRTC.
