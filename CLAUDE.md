# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Development Commands

- **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
- **Development mode**: `npm run dev` (runs Vite in development mode)
- **Build the library**: `npm run build` (uses svelte-package to build the library)
- **Run tests**: `npm run test` (runs all Vitest tests)
- **Test-driven development**: `npm run tdd` (runs Vitest in watch mode)
- **Lint code**: `npm run lint` (runs ESLint on src and tests)
- **Fix linting issues**: `npm run lint:fix` (auto-fixes ESLint issues)

## Project Overview

Patches is a TypeScript library for building real-time collaborative applications. It leverages Operational Transformation (OT) with a centralized server model to ensure document consistency across multiple clients.

### Import Paths

The library uses subpath exports. Use these import paths:

- Main/Client: `@dabble/patches`
- Client-specific: `@dabble/patches/client`
- Server components: `@dabble/patches/server`
- Networking: `@dabble/patches/net`
- WebRTC: `@dabble/patches/webrtc`

### Key Features

- **Centralized OT**: Uses a central server to definitively order operations
- **Immutable State**: Document state is immutable, with changes creating new objects
- **Linear History**: Server maintains a single, linear history of document revisions
- **Offline Support**: Includes versioning and snapshot functionality
- **Branching**: Supports branch creation and merging for concurrent work
- **Transport Options**: WebSocket and WebRTC support for networking

## Architecture

The codebase is divided into client-side and server-side components:

### Client-Side Components

1. **Patches**: Main client coordinator and public API
   - Document lifecycle management and event coordination
2. **PatchesDoc**: Document interface focused on app interaction
   - Local state management and change API
   - Uses algorithm functions for change creation
3. **PatchesSync**: Sync coordinator between client and server
   - Orchestrates OT operations using algorithm functions
   - Handles connection management and batching
4. **PatchesStore**: Client-side storage interface
   - Implementations: InMemoryStore, IndexedDBStore

### Server-Side Components

1. **PatchesServer**: Core server-side authority
   - Processes incoming changes, assigns revisions
   - Uses server algorithm functions for state management
   - Maintains document history
2. **PatchesStoreBackend**: Server-side storage interface
3. **PatchesHistoryManager**: Handles document history and versioning
4. **PatchesBranchManager**: Manages branching and merging workflows

### Algorithm Layer

1. **Client Algorithms**: Pure functions for client-side operations
   - `makeChange`: Creates change objects from mutations
   - `applyCommittedChanges`: Merges server updates with local state
   - `createStateFromSnapshot`: Builds current state from snapshots
   - `breakChange`, `breakIntoBatches`: Handles large change splitting

2. **Shared Algorithms**: Core OT logic used by both client and server
   - `applyChanges`: Applies change sequences to states
   - `rebaseChanges`: Core operational transformation logic

3. **Server Algorithms**: Server-specific state management
   - `getStateAtRevision`, `getSnapshotAtRevision`: Historical state retrieval
   - `handleOfflineSessionsAndBatches`: Offline sync processing

### Networking & Persistence

1. **Transport Layer**:
   - **WebSocketTransport**: Server-mediated communication
   - **WebRTCTransport**: Peer-to-peer communication

### OT Implementation

The system uses JSON Patch operations (RFC 6902) with custom OT transformations to handle concurrent edits. The OT logic has been extracted into pure algorithm functions, making it easier to test and reuse.

## Code Structure

- `/src/client`: Client-side implementation
- `/src/server`: Server-side implementation
- `/src/algorithms`: Pure algorithm functions for OT and sync operations
  - `/client`: Client-specific algorithms
  - `/server`: Server-specific algorithms  
  - `/shared`: Common algorithms used by both client and server
- `/src/net`: Networking and transport layer
- `/src/json-patch`: JSON Patch operations and transformations
- `/tests`: Test files matching the source structure

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Change Processing Flow**:

   - Client calls `doc.change()` → `makeChange` algorithm creates change objects
   - Change applied locally (optimistic update)
   - `PatchesSync` batches and sends changes to server
   - Server transforms against concurrent changes, assigns new revision
   - Server changes flow back → `PatchesSync` uses `applyCommittedChanges` algorithm
   - `applyCommittedChanges` calls `rebaseChanges` to handle conflicts
   - Updated state propagated to `PatchesDoc` and UI

2. **Versioning**:

   - System creates snapshots after 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Each version may represent one or many changes
   - Allows efficient loading of large documents with many changes

3. **State Handling**:

   - Document state is immutable
   - Changes are made through proxy in `doc.change(state => state.prop = 'new value')`
   - Uses immutable-style updates for performance and consistency

4. **Performance Characteristics**:

   - Handles documents with over 480k operations
   - Load time: 1-2ms for large documents
   - Change application: 0.2ms per operation
   - Scales linearly with document size through snapshots rather than history size

5. **Usage Example**:

   ```typescript
   // Client-side
   import { Patches, InMemoryStore } from '@dabble/patches/client';
   import { PatchesSync } from '@dabble/patches/net';
   
   const patches = new Patches({ store: new InMemoryStore() });
   const sync = new PatchesSync(patches, 'wss://server.com');

   // Server-side
   import { PatchesServer } from '@dabble/patches/server';
   
   const server = new PatchesServer(store);
   ```

## Testing Approach

Tests are written using Vitest and follow a structure mirroring the source code. Most tests use mocking to isolate components.

To run a single test file:

```bash
npm run test -- tests/path/to/file.spec.ts
```

To run tests with a specific pattern:

```bash
npm run test -- -t "test description pattern"
```

- **When writing tests, always run them and fix the errors**
- **When refactoring code, fix the tests and documentation for that code at the same time.**

## Architecture Analysis and Critical Issues

### Architectural Insights

1. **Four-Layer Architecture**:

   - **Application Layer**: Patches, PatchesDoc for user-facing API
   - **Orchestration Layer**: PatchesSync coordinates between layers
   - **Algorithm Layer**: Pure functions handle OT and state operations
   - **Transport Layer**: Pluggable networking (WebSocket/WebRTC)

2. **State Management Approach**:

   - Immutable state with proxy-based change tracking
   - Optimistic client updates with server reconciliation
   - Algorithm functions handle state transformations
   - Linear history with snapshot-based versioning

3. **Separation of Concerns**:

   - **Pure algorithms** for testable, reusable OT logic
   - **Orchestration classes** handle coordination and events
   - **Clean interfaces** between layers
   - **Focused responsibilities** for each component

4. **Concurrency Model**:
   - Centralized server arbitrates operation order
   - Client-side rebasing for pending changes
   - Event-driven architecture with signal patterns
